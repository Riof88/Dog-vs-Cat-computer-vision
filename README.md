# Dog vs Cat Classification with Preprocessing

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats.  
Before training, the images are enhanced using preprocessing techniques such as noise removal and deblurring to improve model performance.

## 🧠 What’s Inside
1. **Salt-and-Pepper Noise Removal** using Median Filter  
2. **Motion Blur Correction** with Wiener Filter  
3. **CNN Model** built with Keras  
4. **Image Augmentation** via `ImageDataGenerator`  
5. **Model Evaluation** using Confusion Matrix
